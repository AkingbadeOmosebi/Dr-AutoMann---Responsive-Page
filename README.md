This is just a warm up for a little fun/refresher project to get my hands dirty again. 
I'm trying to build an Auto Mechanic specialist/Technician webpage.
I plan to add contents with time, and develop it. 
Going by the "Build it as you fly it approach"
Up next Either About us or Login page.

Feel free to contribute to this project if interested and feel free to reach out to me if interested for any questions.

Thank you.


#SVG files for menu open and close icon were downloaded from the following link: https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:close:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.size=24&icon.color=%23e8eaed
#Background wallpaper does not belong to me, It was gotten from Google image search > Pexel Images, "I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE IMAGE", I simply found it good looking and worth appreciable and therefore decided to use it for a fun project. (If the owner is uncomfortable with it, Kindly leave a message, and I'll replace it. Thank you.)
